# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Important Info
Sample object data  can be found in data.ts (vehicleParts and vehicleList)

## Assumption
- In this project I assume that a car might have 1 type out of 3 types (Electrical,sport, or two wheels)
- Car of each type might have multiple parts, and each part might belong to other car type. Like battery might be available for two wheels car,electric car and sport car (Porche Taycan is a sport electric car) and electric car
- The find vehicle application will output a car names based on the selected filter.
